  \item What do me mean by FaaS?
  \item Benefits of FaaS
  \item Challenges of FaaS
  \item Understanding cost and cost implications
  \item Concrete examples
  \begin{itemize}
    \item REST API

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What do we mean by FaaS?}
Simply put: AWS Lambda and managed services like DynamoDB
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Benefits of FaaS}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lower costs
  \item Simplicity
  \item More testable architecture
  \item Replicability
  \item Driftlessness
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Challenges of FaaS I}
Challenges:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Vendor lock-in
  \item New idiom, a lot to learn
  \item Not suited to every task
  \item Accidental costs can accumulate
  \item Possible to make a real mess
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Challenges of FaaS II}
How to deal with them:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Be aware that the code should be portable, but don't strive for project-defeating generics
  \item Understand the offerings, learn about infrastructure as code
  \item Be aware that most things can be solved with Lambdas, the question is whether they should be
  \item Keep an eye on what costs are accumulating by setting up cost reports, automate resource deprovisioning
  \item Discipline is important: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item TDD \& BDD/FDD are essential
    \item Code hygene and QA equally so
    \item having continuous deployment as a constant and understood aim
    \item Infrastructure as code is an absolute
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Understanding costs \& cost implications}
Cheap:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some stuff costs a lot
  \item Some stuff costs little, if it is used correctly
\end{itemize}
Cheap isn't always good
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some stuff is cheaper to implement in different ways
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cost for light usage for some services is high (CloudSearch)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Some stuff is more performant if implemented in different ways
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Long-running and/or processor-intensive processes are better run in EC2 as Lambda becomes expensive in these cases
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Basically, know your needs; know the platform; use the appropriate technology.

\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Infrastructure as code is alpha \& omega
  \item Automated deployment of services ("Driftløs")
  \item Choose the right DevOps approach and develop it
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Test-first, test-last and test everything inbetween
    \item CD
    \item Stamp out laziness
  \end{itemize}
  \item Read the DORA report for inspiration
\end{itemize}
